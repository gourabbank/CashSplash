Competitive Analysis 

Mint: A well-established app that offers comprehensive budgeting, financial tracking, and insights. It syncs with bank accounts to track spending automatically. While it provides a broad overview of your finances, it can feel cluttered and overwhelming for users who prefer simplicity.
YNAB (You Need A Budget): YNAB focuses heavily on proactive budgeting, helping users assign every dollar a specific job. It promotes strict budgeting habits and is highly effective for users wanting to build better financial discipline. However, its subscription fee and learning curve may deter casual users.
PocketGuard: This app gives users a quick glance at how much money they can spend by factoring in their expenses, bills, and savings goals. It’s user-friendly but lacks deeper analytics and customization options that more advanced users might desire.
Wally: A simple and clean app for tracking income and expenses, Wally supports multiple currencies and is popular with international users. While it excels in simplicity, it lacks detailed features for long-term budgeting or financial goal setting.
Splitwise: A popular app for splitting bills and shared expenses, especially among friends or roommates. It’s ideal for tracking who owes what when sharing meals, rent, or vacations. While great for group expenses, Splitwise doesn’t offer detailed personal finance management, making it a complementary rather than a standalone budgeting tool.
CashSplash sets itself apart by combining personalised expense tracking with offline capabilities, real-time sync across devices, and Firebase-based scalability, making it a highly responsive and user-friendly option for everyday budget management.
